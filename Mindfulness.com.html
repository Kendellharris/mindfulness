	<p>I like the community norms that we came up with like positivity. Positivity is a important community norm cause negativity can hold you back but positivity can have an boost your confidence. Another community norm that rich 2 came up with is respect. I feel like respect is an important norm because a lot people disrespect elders or adults because people either feel threatened or disrespected.</p>

<p>Me and my brothers solve problems by talking about our ideas and what were thinking about. We could also talk about what are opinions are thinking about. Early today we read a story about these brothers and one brother was happy because he was getting food and all the other brothers were sad cause they weren't eating like his brother. That's when they came up with ubuntu which means i am because we are. They said that cause you can't be happy cause we're sad.</p>

<p>Today's quote of the day was about being prepared for anything. One of the quotes said “ it's better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have to have on opportunity and not prepared”.-Whitney.m.young. “ An army of sheep led by a lion can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep”. I don't know what the second quote is talking about but I think it's saying that you have to be a strong leader but first you have to have practice or training to be a go leader or king. You not being a strong leader is like a king not having a kingdom.</p>

<p>Today's topic of the day was about staying prepared is really important cause if you stay prepare you don't have to get ready. For example if your going to a job interview and you practiced what your going to say and your prepared on what your going to say and most likely get there job. If your not prepared then you most likely not get the job or any interview cause bosses look at how organized you are first.

Mr King's quote is basically saying that if people don't learn how to live and work together they can be lost or left behind.

<p>Our topic of the day is about how to respect yourself. One way of respecting yourself is to treat people the way you want to be treated.Another way to respect yourself is to respect your elders  by not using profanity around them and or addressing adults as sir or mam .

<p>What does it mean to be a black man. What it means to be a black man in america is we get mistreated by america and we have to deal with white people out stereotypes that are just judging black people especially if you don't know me. For example white people always judge black people cause that's what they see from one black person.

<p>“I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves”- Harriet Tubman. Harriet Tubman freed a lot of slaves and some of the slaves didn't know they were slaves because they were brainwashed by their masters. The white people made it illegal for slaves to read because they were scared that if we read a book we gain knowledge and possibly realize that were slaves that  could outsmart the white man and escape slavery.</p>

<p>Our topic of the day is about being positive. The reason why it's good to stay positive cause people will see that you like to have positive energy around you and want to use that energy to make them feel good because of their own personal issues. Another reason why you and people around you should stay positive is because positive things can happen to you if you treat someone nice then you will be rewarded by god</p>
