	<p>I like the community norms that we came up with like positivity. Positivity is a important community norm cause negativity can hold you back but positivity can have an boost your confidence. Another community norm that rich 2 came up with is respect. I feel like respect is an important norm because a lot people disrespect elders or adults because people either feel threatened or disrespected.</p>
